# APA Health Fair Call Assignments
Hello! This is a script for [Asian Pacific American Health Care(APAHC)](https://www.apahcare.com/) at UCLA. This script matches the club's Customer Relations(CR) committee with the clients that are served at APA Health Fairs for follow up calls. The CR members and clients are matched based on the languages they speak so that these calls go smoothly. 

## How to Run the Script
If you want to run the script for call assignments, follow the link to the [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hcid6-ct_Tm448c1Czqiftb48dYfkurI?usp=sharing). 

1. Upload the file. **The file must be a .csv file**

## Notes
The script is set to run on the spreadsheets APAHC uses in their health fairs in 2023. If there are any updates that break the script, please reach out to me and I will try to fix it promptly.
